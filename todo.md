## To-do:

- [ ] include .fasta refseq processing
- [ ] if multiple refseqs, plot for each amplicon (currently it will overlay the amplicons)
- [ ] include long-read fastq processing (minimap2)
- [ ] allow space in input (.fa and .fastq) file names
- [ ] interactive delta mutation rate analysis (maybe Shiny)
- [ ] change to download the latest release archive, and keep the scripts for every run
- [ ] tutorial includes explanantion for input (refseq trimming, how many amplicons per run, etc)
- [ ] hide error folder, show only when there are files in it after finishing (mv)
- [ ] basic QC in the process, such as coverage
